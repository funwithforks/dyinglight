Automatic scripts for Dying Light

dyinglight.py only does agility farming.
To run it you need python 3 and pynput.
It doesn't matter if you start the script first or the game first. After both the script and the game are running, in game go to a corner and press Crtl+Alt+p and it will start going. When you are done, tap shift, then Crtl+Alt+p and it will stop. The script will still be running in the background so if you press Crtl+Alt+p again it will start again. To quit the script, press Crtl+Alt+q. If shift is held down by the script then tap shift then Crtl+Alt+p
